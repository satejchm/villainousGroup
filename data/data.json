    },
    {
        "question": "If I reveal a Fate card that cannot be played, do I get to reveal a new one? ",
        "answer": "No. If a Fate card cannot be played (for example, you revealed an Item and there is no Hero in the Realm to attach itto), the card may not be played and must be discarded. If you are taking a Fate action and both cards revealed cannotbe played, you must discard both of them without effect. Fate favored your opponent this time!"

    {
        "question": "If I defeat a Hero during my turn and action symbols are uncovered at my Villain’s location, may I perform thoseactions on this turn? ",
        "answer": "Yes. If an action symbol at your location is uncovered during your turn, you may immediately perform the action.Likewise, if an action symbol is covered before you perform that action on your turn, you may not perform the action."
    },
    {
        "question": "If multiple Heroes are at one location, do I have to defeat them in a certain order? ",
        "answer": "No. If multiple Heroes are at a location, you may choose which Hero to defeat."
    },
    {
        "question": "I have a card that will allow me to defeat a Hero with a Strength of 4 or less. Does this refer to the Strength printed onthe Hero card, or do I factor in other card Abilities? ",
        "answer": "Whenever referring to a Hero’s (or Ally’s) Strength, always consider all other card Abilities that are in effect in the Realm.For example, if a Hero has a Strength of 5 printed on their card, but another card in the Realm gives them -1 Strength,then that Hero’s Strength is considered to be 4 for all purposes. "
    }, {
        "question": "If a Hero’s Strength is reduced to 0 by other card Abilities, can I just remove that Hero from the Realm? ",
        "answer": "No. You must still use a Vanquish action or card Ability to defeat the Hero. However, if you use a Vanquish action, noAllies need to be discarded. You can defeat the Hero even if you have no Allies at the Hero’s location."
    },
    {
        "question": "If I use a card’s Activated Ability, do I then discard it?",
        "answer": "No. The card remains in your Realm. There is no limit to the number of times you may activate a card’s Ability, providedyou use an Activate action and pay the card’s Activation Cost, if any, each time. "
    },
    {
        "question": "Can I play or move a Hero to the bottom of the Board? ",
        "answer": "No. Fate cards are always played to and moved across the top of the Board, unless a card Ability specifically instructsyou to move a Fate card to the bottom of the Board."
    },
    {
        "question": "If I can’t do what a card says, can I still play it? ",
        "answer": "No. If you cannot do what the card says, then you cannot play it. However, if the cardsays “may,” the text that follows is optional. In this case, you may play the card andthen choose whether or not to do that part of its Ability. If you cannot play a card,you can discard it by performing the Discard Cards action. "
    },
    {
        "question": "Is there a hand limit? ",
        "answer": "No. There is no limit to the number of cards in your hand at any time, but you willonly draw cards at the end of your turn if you have fewer than four"
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if I need to take Power, but the Supply is empty?",
        "answer": "Power is considered infinite. You can grab other tokens or coins to use asadditional Power"
    },
    {
        "question": "Can I look through my discard piles? What about an opponent’sdiscard piles? ",
        "answer": "Yes. All cards that are face up are public, and any player may look through anydiscard pile at any time."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can I play or move a Hero to the bottom of the Board? ",
        "answer": "No. Fate cards are always played to and moved across the top of the Board, unless acard Ability specifically instructs you to move a Fate card to the bottom of the Board."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can I play a Condition at any time during another player’s turn, aslong as the requirement was met at some point during that turn? ",
        "answer": "No. A Condition card can only be played when the requirement is met. For example,if the requirement is that another player defeats a Hero with a Strength of 3 ormore, you must play your Condition card when that Hero is defeated. You may notwait until later in the turn. However, playing a Condition is optional. So in the sameexample, you may choose not to play your Condition, and instead play it later,when a different player defeats a Hero or the same player defeats another Hero"
    },
    {
        "question": "Before I can win, am I required to defeat all the Heroes in my Realm,or have my Villain Mover at a specific location? ",
        "answer": "No. Only your Objective needs to be achieved in order to win. Your Villain Guidedescribes your Objective and how it is achieved. Some Villains are not required todefeat any Heroes, although leaving Heroes in your realm may slow your progresstoward victory"
    },
    {
        "question": "Which Villain is the easiest to win with? ",
        "answer": "Each Villain, when played with skill and cunning, is equally prepared to achievetheir Objective. However, the strategies utilized by each Villain vary in complexity. "
